It is a music website clown where any user can listen to songs present on the website. This website is created using HTML, CSS,JavaScript.
Implementation of website:-
To create an audio player, I used the HTML <audio> element to embed the audio file on the webpage. Then, using JavaScript, I added event listeners to control the playback, volume, and other functionalities such as I have use play(), pause(), and volume properties to handle play, pause, and volume control, respectively.

Applying retro-themed CSS styles:
To give the website a vintage look, I have used CSS styles like textured backgrounds, retro fonts, faded color schemes, and perhaps some subtle animation effects reminiscent of old music players or cassette tapes. Adding borders and shadows to buttons and elements could create a 3D or embossed effect commonly seen in retro design
I have used CSS media queries to adapt the layout and styles based on the screen size. This way, the website will look good and be easy to use on both desktop and mobile devices.
